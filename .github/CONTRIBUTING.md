## Opening pull requests

### Choose a good PR title

Avoid long names in your PR titles. Make sure your title has fewer than 60 characters.

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) guidelines and keywords to find the best title.

Use parentheses to identify the package or feature that you worked on. For example:  `feat(services/chain)`, `fix(scaffolding)`.

### Review your own code

Make sure that you manually tested the changes you're introducing before creating a PR or pushing another commit.

Monitor your PR to make sure that all CI checks pass and the PR shows **All checks have passed** (the checkmark is green).

### Avoid rebasing commits in your branch

Avoid rebasing after you open your PRs to reviews. Instead, add more commits to your PR. It's OK to do force pushes if the PR is still in draft mode and was never opened to reviews before.

A reviewer likes to see a linear commit history while reviewing. If you tend to force push from an older commit, reviewer might lose track in your recent changes and will have to start reviewing from scratch.

Don't worry about adding too many commits. The commits are squashed into a single commit while merging. Your PR title is used as the commit message.

### Ask for help

If you started a PR but couldn't finish it for whatever reason, don't give up. Instead, just ask for help. Someone else can take over and assume the ownership.

We appreciate every bit of your work!
